## Part 1:  Train Word2Vec Model, Select Hyperparameters, Evaluate Performance on Google Analogy Test, and Explore Models

## Part 2A: Try a Geometric Approach to Extrat Bias inspired by Bolukbasi et al 2016

## Part 2B: Try another (slightly twist) Geometric Approach to Extract Bias

## Part 2C: Try a Machine-Learning Classifier instead of a Geometic approch to extract Bias
